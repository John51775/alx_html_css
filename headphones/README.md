🌐 Web Page Project — Built From Scratch

A fully responsive, accessible, pixel-aligned web layout built without frameworks — pure HTML5, CSS3, and modern best practices.
This project demonstrates structure, semantic markup, layout engineering, responsive thinking, usability, and performance considerations.

💡 The goal of this project was not only to build a page, but to understand how the browser sees, renders, and responds to code — earning mastery through creation.

✨ Features

✔ Fully hand-coded — no external UI libraries
✔ Responsive layout with breakpoints for mobile, tablet, desktop
✔ Semantic HTML elements for structure and accessibility
✔ Flexbox / Grid used for layout
✔ WCAG-friendly practices (contrast, alt tags, aria labels)
✔ Clean, readable and scalable CSS architecture
✔ Reusable utility classes
✔ Hover / interaction states
✔ Mobile-first performance mindset

📌 Project Objective

Replicate the design file as accurately as possible while demonstrating:

Understanding of HTML structure

Layout strategies (Grid / Flexbox)

Typography hierarchy

Color systems

Responsive behavior

Accessibility principles

Visual consistency

🎯 The mission is mastery by doing, not just coding — learning why decisions are made.

🧱 Tech Stack
🔹 HTML5

For structure, semantics, and document meaning.

🔹 CSS3

For styling, responsiveness, layout systems, and interaction states.

No frameworks, no preprocessors — pure fundamentals.

🚀 How to Run the Project

Download / clone the repository

Open index.html in any browser

Resize window to experience responsive behavior

🧩 Core Concepts Demonstrated
✔ Semantic HTML

<header>

<nav>

<main>

<section>

<article>

<footer>

These help structure meaning for:

Search engines (SEO)

Screen readers (Accessibility)

Developers (Team readability)

✔ Accessibility

Alt attributes for images

Proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)

ARIA labels where appropriate

Focus visible states

✔ Responsive Design

Mobile-first approach

CSS media queries for multiple breakpoints

Relative units (%, rem, vh, vw)

Because great UI is useless without adaptability.

✔ CSS Architecture

Component-based styling

Utility classes for spacing + alignment

BEM-inspired class naming readability

✔ Layout Engineering

Flexbox for alignment and stacking

CSS Grid for structured sections

🧪 Challenges Learned

✔ Aligning structure to design grid
✔ Thinking in mobile-first shifts
✔ Avoiding overuse of divs
✔ Staying consistent with spacing scales
✔ Debugging with browser inspector

Every frustration is knowledge encoded — design thinking grows through friction.

⭐ Author’s Reflection

This project was a major hands-on learning experience in:

Thinking like a browser and building intentionally, not accidentally.

By avoiding shortcuts and libraries, I gained:

Stronger fundamentals

Ability to debug layout issues

Better understanding of spacing, typography, and accessibility
